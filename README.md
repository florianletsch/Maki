# Maki
Proof of concept Mac app that sends text to associated iOS keyboard. Originally built to assist typing large amounts of text into iOS messengers that don't have macOS counterparts.

Note:
- Messages are sent via a web socket as plain text
- iOS keyboards can only enter messages into text fields, not hit send buttons
- Mostly obsolete now WhatsApp has a web/macOS client
